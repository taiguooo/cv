        I am a master student at Stanford University studying <a href="https://mse.stanford.edu/">materials sciences</a>, but have a strong interest in computer science. 
        I love solving pratical problems, and software engineers are those who develop new tools and applications that generate
        huge impacts on the real world. Therefore, I'm currently preparing me to be a good software engineer and 
        <strong>looking for poosible interships next summer (summer 2022).</strong>

        Before I came to Stanford, I studied nanosciences for my undergrad in both China and Canada. My undergrad program is a collaborative program, 
        and I spent the first two years at <a href="http://en.njtu.edu.cn/">Beijing Jiaotong University</a> in Beijing, China, and then, I moved to Canada, finished my degree
        at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> in Canada.
